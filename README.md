# Book Recommendation System

The Book Recommendation project aims to provide personalized book recommendations to users based on their interests and previous data history. The project uses collaborative filtering, specifically the matrix factorization algorithm, to generate accurate and relevant book recommendations.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to recommend books to users that match their preferences and reading history. By leveraging collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques, the system can identify patterns in user behavior and provide tailored book suggestions.

## Approach

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a powerful recommendation technique that analyzes user behavior and preferences to generate personalized recommendations. It leverages the collective knowledge of users with similar interests, making it highly effective in suggesting relevant items.

### Matrix Factorization

Matrix factorization is a critical component of collaborative filtering. The algorithm decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, allowing the system to handle large datasets and make accurate predictions efficiently. The recommendation system can identify hidden patterns and offer better book suggestions by representing users and items in a latent space.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains approximately 300,000 records and is divided into three files:

1. Book Data: Contains information about the books, such as Book IDs, titles, authors, genres, and publication details.

2. User Data: Provides user-related information, including User IDs, demographic data, and preferences.

3. Rating Data: Contains user ratings for various books, linking users to their rated books.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The dataset undergoes a cleaning process to ensure data integrity, where duplicate records are removed. Once cleaned, the three files (book, user, and rating data) are merged based on common Book IDs, creating a comprehensive dataset for the recommendation system.

Feature engineering techniques are also applied to enhance the recommendation process during data preparation. These techniques involve extracting relevant features from the dataset to improve the accuracy of book recommendations.

## Recommendation System

The recommendation system is built on collaborative filtering principles, analyzing user behavior and preferences to provide relevant book suggestions. The matrix factorization algorithm decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors, enabling efficient and accurate book recommendations.

## Installation and Usage

To use the Book Recommendation System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Adityakumar92/Book_Recomendation.git
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Ensure you have the dataset files (book data, user data, and rating data) in the appropriate format and directory.
4. Run the recommendation system using `python recommendation_system.py`.
5. The system will prompt users to input their preferences or use historical data to generate personalized book recommendations.
